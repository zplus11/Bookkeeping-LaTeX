# bklatex
Typeset accounting journals and ledgers with LaTeX easily using this python library.

⚠️ To run this program, you need to have the following installed:
- a LaTeX distribution with `pdflatex`. See [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
- Python. See [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Program
bklatex helps typeset accounting journals and ledgers using LaTeX and some programming. Rather than typesetting them yourself, you can use the classes and methods defined in `bklatex.py` and create a Python script to easily have them typeset by Python.

## Documentation
A thorough documentation is provided in `documentation\bklatex_docs.pdf`. Keep in mind this documentation is still work in progress like this whole project.

## Illustration
Appropriate illustrations are given in the `illustrations` directory.

⚠️ Keep in mind this is still a work in progress. In particular, printing ledgers needs more work.

Thank you for reading this far.
